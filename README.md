WWIVToss Setup for Linux
========================

WWIVToss by Craig Dooley is a utility that allows WWIV BBSes to participate in FTN type networks.
The packer/tosser binaries work in DOSemu on Linux. However, the setup utility, WSETUP, doesn't.
It worked fine in DOSBox, IIRC, but for some reason, I couldn't use it.

This code is the result of reverse engineering the binary config files and copying the essential
User Interface design of WSETUP but implementing it from the ground up. This was done around 2014
until 2018. Screenshots are available at http://aliens.ph/~xenos/wwivtoss-linux/

This tool is no longer needed because the newer releases of WWIV 5.x have "networkf" and support
FTN type networks baked in.
